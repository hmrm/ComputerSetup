All over the place, but particular thanks to purcell/emacs.d and bbatsov/prelude.

#Usage#
* This could only possibly work on debian-based machines, and has only been "tested" on ubuntu
* sudo make install
* expects to be cloned into a "ComputerSetup" in the home folder.
* yeah, good luck actually getting the above to work
* you probably want to do this with --ignore-errors on a very specific target and hope it works
